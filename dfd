notes

In this DFD:

The "User Interface" component represents the graphical user interface (GUI) created using Tkinter.
The "Python Code (Script)" component includes the Python script that contains the logic for running security tests.
The "External Components" represent external libraries and services,
such as the requests library for making HTTP requests.

The flow of data and interactions in the system is as follows:

1)The user interacts with the GUI by entering a target URL and clicking the "Run Tests" button.
2)The "URL Entry" component collects the target URL input from the user.
3)The "Run Tests" button triggers the execution of the "Run Tests" function in the Python code.
4)The Python code processes the input, including the target URL, XSS payloads, SQL payloads, and actions.
5)It sends HTTP requests to the external components (e.g., external services) using the requests library.
6)The external components receive the requests and send responses back to the Python code.
7)The Python code analyzes the responses and checks for potential security vulnerabilities (XSS, SQL injection, CSRF).
8)The results are displayed in the GUI using message boxes.

This DFD provides a high-level overview of how data flows and how the components interact in the security testing tool system.
